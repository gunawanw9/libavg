After the installer runs, please make sure that everything works by running the tests. To do this, open a terminal and enter the following commands:

$ cd /usr/local/share/python-libavg/test
$ python Test.py

You should see some test graphics flicker on the screen, and the last message in the terminal should read 'OK'.

We welcome your feedback. See http://www.libavg.de/ for details.
